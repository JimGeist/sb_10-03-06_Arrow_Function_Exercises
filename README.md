# sb_10-03-06_Arrow_Function_Exercises
Completed exercises that involved refactoring ES5 functions into ES2015 functions that used arrow functions.

Exercise required refactoring 2 functions from ES5 to ES2015. The functions had to utilize arrow functions for the callbacks. 
Jasmine tests were created to 'compare' the results of the ES5 function to the ES2015 function. Since the functions 
output arrays and I did not see a matcher for an array, a function was created to compare two arrays and return
true when the arrays have the same values but are different reference objects. The old ES5 and the updated ES2015 
version were input to the arraysAreTheSame function.
